# Heterogeneous-Localisation-Swift-Hohenberg
The file *runAndPlot.m* does what it says, and calls the file *plotSols.m* to do the plotting. The plots show the solution $u$, the functions $r(x)$ and $q_c(x)$, regions where $r>0$ (vertical red lines), and if the homogeneous stability condition ($r-q_c(x)^4<0$) is not satisfied in some regions, it will plot the degree of violation, that is the function $r-q_c(x)^4$. A second space-time plot is also produced which exists to determine if a steady state solution has been reached, or in case something spatiotemporal happens. In the case of spatiotemporal behaviour (or transients), the file *plotTime.m* will show a video of the solution in time.

**Warning:** the number of grid points $N$ should be sufficiently large to avoid numerical issues, especially for small $\varepsilon$ or large $q_c$. To check if it is sufficiently large, comment out the plot labelled p1 in *plotSols.m* and uncomment out the line above, checking that there are many discrete points used per peak (ideally $O(20)$ or so grid points per oscillation/peak).
